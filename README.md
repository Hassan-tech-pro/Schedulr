# Schedulr
Schedulr is a smart timetable maker that removes conflicts between teachers, groups, and rooms. It takes a simple CSV file of courses and automatically creates a schedule using graph-based algorithms. No clashes, no wasted time â€” just a clean and fair timetable in seconds.



Problem Statement

Making timetables is hard. Teachers clash, groups overlap, and rooms double-book. Doing it by hand wastes hours and still leads to mistakes.



Solution Approach

Smart Scheduler is a graph-based scheduling tool built with Python + Streamlit.
Courses are nodes in a graph
Edges represent conflicts (same teacher or same group)
A greedy algorithm assigns time slots and rooms without conflicts
Output is a clean schedule in CSV format



Why it works

No manual slot assignment
Avoids teacher & group clashes
Supports multiple room types (lecture, lab, etc.)
Runs instantly after CSV upload
